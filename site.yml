# Ansible playbook to set up the general things in the whole MDBconductor cluster.
#
# We first set a valid hostname, populate /etc/hosts, etc.
# Some variables, such as `inventory_hostname` are built into Ansible.
# Others, such as `private_ip`, are extracted from the Terraform state by
# script `{staging, production}/read_tfstate`.
# If you haven't run Terraform for a while you can update its state by running
# `terraform refresh` in '{staging, production}/terra'.
